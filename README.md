# GifTastic
Using the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page! To finish this task, I must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of my site.

This project was created for API practice and demonstration that could be linked to a practice bootcamp portfolio

It's ongoing but it works! The gifs are generated 10 at a time and can be access and referenced through buttons appended with your input.


Code Used:
JavaScript - jQuery
CSS - Bootstrap


API Reference
https://developers.giphy.com/

How to use:
Reference and inspect the code for examples of stopping and starting gifs as well as making AJAX calls. Page uses bootstrap to provide a measure of mobile accessibility.
